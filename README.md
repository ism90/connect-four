## Game Rules 

#### Objective:

To be the first player to connect 4 of the same colored discs in a row (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).

#### How to Play:

- Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn.
- On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots.
- The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
- The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.
