## Pseudocode for JS Game Challenge

### Connect Four!


---

#### 1. Grid

- Approach: auto generate html for grid of 'slots'
- Initiate two empty arrays 
  - columnsArray = [];
  - slotsArray = [];
- For loop to push 7 columns of divs to columnArray
- For loop to push 6 rows of slots to columnsArray
- Creating an array of columns with a row array in each column (hopefully)
- Initial state of slots to be set as empty string

#### 2. Player Moves

- 

#### 3. Win/Draw Conditions

- 

#### Extra

- Potential variations on the normal rules - pop out, power up etc
- If time allows, look into MinMax (recursion) for computer moves


#### Notes
